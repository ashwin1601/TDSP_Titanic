# Data and Feature Definitions

This document provides a central hub for the raw data sources, the processed/transformed data, and feature sets. More details of each dataset is provided in the data summary report. 

For each data, an individual report describing the data schema, the meaning of each data field, and other information that is helpful for understanding the data is provided. If the dataset is the output of processing/transforming/feature engineering existing data set(s), the names of the input data sets, and the links to scripts that are used to conduct the operation are also provided. 

When applicable, the Interactive Data Exploration, Analysis, and Reporting (IDEAR) utility developed by Microsoft is applied to explore and visualize the data, and generate the data report. Instructions of how to use IDEAR can be found [here](). 

For each dataset, the links to the sample datasets in the _**Data**_ directory are also provided. 

_**For ease of modifying this report, placeholder links are included in this page, for example a link to dataset 1, but they are just placeholders pointing to a non-existent page. These should be modified to point to the actual location.**_


## Raw Data Sources


| Dataset Name | Original Location   | Destination Location  | Data Movement Tools / Scripts | Link to Report |
| ---:| ---: | ---: | ---: | -----: |
| Training Set | Available Online on Kaggle | Uploaded on Git repository | N/A | https://github.com/ashwin1601/TDSP_Titanic/blob/master/train.xlsx|
| Test Set | Available Online on Kaggle | Uploaded on Git repository | N/A | https://github.com/ashwin1601/TDSP_Titanic/blob/master/test.csv |

* Training set summary. Access the data via Git. Training set to be used to create the machine learning models. The outcome for the passengers has been provided. The model will be developed on the features included. 
* Test set summary. Access the data via Git. Test set to be used to see how well the model performs on unseen data. The model will be used to predict the outcome for each passenger, whether or not they survive the sinking of the titanic. 

## Processed Data
| Processed Dataset Name | Input Dataset(s)   | Data Processing Tools/Scripts | Link to Report |
